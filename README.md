# Excel Projects
 In this project, I generate the MIS (Management Information System) and Finance reports (Profit & Loss Statement reports). P&L statement provides me a overview of the Profitability of the company on the bases of market, products, Monthly and Quarterly revenue and Net sales of the company and also identify the area of improvement.

This is a Scenario Planning tool which is help to choose the best case for the Business. For example: - A customer buy a products and he negotiate for the discount on the products. So the sales manager can easily find the best case which would be more appropriate for the business.
